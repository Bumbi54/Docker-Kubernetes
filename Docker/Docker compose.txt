Specific syntax.
  Uses yaml format.

"version: '3'"
  Version of docker compose we want to use.

"services:"
  In broad terms in means container.
  Something in the line of type of container.
  In this element we write names or containers we want to create.
  For each container name we specify if we want to build it by:
    Using predefined image:
      "image: 'redis'"
    Using Dockerfile:
      "build : ."
        Where Dockerfile is located in same directory as our "docker-compose.yaml" files.

Port-mapping for each of containers is done with:
  """
  ports:
    - "4081:8081"
  """
    We can specify multiple port-mapping by just adding more "-" in new lines. This is an array.
    First is port on local machine and second port on container.

If we create containers in same docker compose file by default they are in same network and can communicate with each other.
  Without opening ports.
  Container name can be used as hostname in other containers.

Example("docker-compose.yaml"):
"""
version: '3'
services:
        redis-server:
                image: 'redis'
        node-app:
                restart: always
                build : .
                ports:
                  - "4081:8081"

"""
