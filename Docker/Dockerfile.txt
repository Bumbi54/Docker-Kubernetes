Line starts with single word instruction telling docker what to do.
  For example: "FROM", "RUN", "CMD"

For cache it makes a difference order of commands.

"FROM"
  Docker image what we want to use as a base image.

"RUN"
  Execute some command.

"CMD"
  Start-up command of container.

"COPY"
  Copy file into a container/image.
  On rebuild if one of the file was changed cache will no longer be used to commands after this one.

"WORKDIR"
  Specify work directory of container.
  Any other command will be relative to this path.
  If this folder doesn't exit it will create it.
  After this we can't use cache version of later commands.
